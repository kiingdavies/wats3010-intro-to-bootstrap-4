Name of site/company: Ameenah E-Store

Description of your design concept/approach: I am using user focused approach because most of the users only need entertaining information. If it not able to keep their interest, the user may click on the back button and will continue the search. Users like the quality and reliability.
They consider rather than read and require immediate satisfaction. Apart from this, if your website design and navigation are not natural, various problems and questions will arise. This will make it difficult for users to understand.

What you hope to accomplish with your design concept/approach: I hope to get the user's attention with my design pattern and make them want to buy more items in my store
